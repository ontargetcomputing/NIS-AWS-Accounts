# CloudFormation Managed Import Guide

The process to import resources which were provisioned via CloudFormation involves the CloudFormation provisioned resources with a Unique tag to signify candidacy for import and ensuring each resources has a **Name** tag.  You can then follow the steps outlined in [Tagged Resources Import Guide](./Tagged_Resources_Import.md)


## TODO
Add some content on how to add the tags to resources and then what to do with the CloudFormation Stack.
